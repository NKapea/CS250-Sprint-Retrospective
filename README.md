## Reflective Responses (Program Essential Questions)

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs starts with active listening and asking clarifying questions to get to the user’s underlying goal. User stories help capture needs in a human-centered way: they describe the user, the need, and the value. This format makes acceptance criteria explicit and allows the team to implement, test, and validate features that directly map to user value. For example, creating a story that requires search results under 300ms ties a clear technical goal to a user benefit.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively: break features into small, testable stories; deliver increments each sprint; and prioritize by business value. I plan to continue using Scrum practices: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Retrospective. I also plan to maintain automated testing (including DB tests), CI/CD pipelines, and migration automation to reduce risk and speed delivery.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, taking ownership of tasks, supporting teammates, and being open to feedback. It also means documenting decisions, raising blockers early, and aligning with the Definition of Done so the whole team can deliver quality work.
